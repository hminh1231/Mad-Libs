# Mad Lib Game
- Here is one of my first projects when studies Python in my school, but now I want to improve it so that's why you can see there are 2 files in there, the original one and the updated one
- The original one I want to leave it there because it's my memory so I can look back to those days when I'm first studying Python
- The updated one so far is similar to the original one but I will update it with more functions and stories for you guys

## Update(05/16/2025)
- So today is the first day I posted my updated file in here and put a read me on it
- This updated version is still on draft but you can still play right now
- Tomorrow or when I have time, I will add more functions to it, right now there's a block of code that I mark it with the line "Under construction" so don't bother about it.

## Update(05/19/2025)
Sorry for my late update, I got something to do in these days, but I already come back and update with some more functions for this project. Here are the detais:
- Add custom stories options for user
- User now can add their own stories and it will be stored in a file
- User can also read back to see what stories that they have so far
- User can play with their own stories
By the way, I still have some urgent things to do so I just can make a few check on this code so far, but I think everything is good now, you can play it now

# ‚≠êPlans for future:
so right now, I don't know what I should improve more for this code but in the future, I want to add this small project into one of my big project so maybe I'll update more if I have any better ideas for this project
