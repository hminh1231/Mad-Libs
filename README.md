# Mad Lib Game
_ Here is one of my first projects when studies Python in my school, but now I want to improve it so that's why you can see there are 2 files in there, the original one and the updated one
_ The original one I want to leave it there because it's my memory so I can look back to those days when I'm first studying Python
_ The updated one so far is similar to the original one but I will update it with more functions and stories for you guys

## Update(05/16/2025)
_ So today is the first day I posted my updated file in here and put a read me on it
_ This updated version is still on draft but you can still play right now
_ Tomorrow or when I have time, I will add more functions to it, right now there's a block of code that I mark it with the line "Under construction" so don't bother about it.
